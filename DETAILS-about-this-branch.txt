This is a child branch by the name of 'master' because the 'master' branch is intended to be the link between WatsonStudio and Github.
And after recent changes the master branch is called the 'main' branch by default. 
So WastsonStudio fails to find the master branch. 
This is a quick hack to fix this issue and allow us to publish files from WatsonStudio to GitHub.
